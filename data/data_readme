Data README:

As required by the DESeq2 R package, the input dataset needs to be:
1. unnormalized
2. be in the format of DESeqDataSet, which can be prepared:

    From transcript abundance files and tximport
    From a count matrix
    From htseq-count files
    From a SummarizedExperiment object

here we are provided with a count matrix (tab delimited text files) by NanoString after data collection, so second approach.

Two things are needed by the function DESeqDataSetFromMatrix to generate a DESeq dataset for further calculation: 
1) raw count matrix and 
2) information about the count matrix. 
By convention, we name them cts and coldata. 

Make sure the column names of cts must match row names of coldata.

Note about pre-processing txt files provided by Nanostring. Unfortunately, R is not happy with | or _ in the dataframe. 

So it's better to use "find and replace" function of text editor and replace all | with . in order to proceed.
